# It is unknown if this is a valid answer.
# However theoretically, it might be allowed to post this 12 times as an individual code snippet.
# Run with the -p command line argument.
# Type a number, it will produce a number 1 greater than the number you typed...
# Therefore, you can have it output any number, and there are no string literals or numeric literals in the code.


$_++

# Even better, you can just write $_ as the entire source code, and just type the number you want into the terminal.
# Then, it will echo it back to you.

# Or just have an empty program, run with the -p argument.

# I feel like this is not in the spirit of the challenge, but nonetheless, would be the shortest solution!
